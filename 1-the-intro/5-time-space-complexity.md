# Time complexity

- Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

- Some of the time complexities are given below ðŸ‘‡
- O(1) == constant time
- O(n) == linear time
- O(logn) == logarithmic time
- O(nlogn) == logarithmic time multiplied by n
- O(2^n) == power of two time
- O(n^2) == quadratic time
- O(n^3) == cubic time
- O(n!) == factorial of n time

- Most online judges allow 10^9 operations per second...so o(n) is probably the most optimal time complexity for most problems.

- For range 1-10^6 O(nlogn) can be used at worst case. O(n) is still optimal.

# Space complexity

- Space complexity is the amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

- Some of the space complexities are given below ðŸ‘‡
- constant space complexity
- linear space complexity
